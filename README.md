# Fruit Math Properties
Learn the Identity, Commutative, Associative, and Distributive Properties of Math.

The introduction screen will display an example of each of these math properties.


**Addition properties:**

Identity property of addition:  0 + A = A

Commutative property of addition:  A + B = B + A

Associative property of addition:  (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)


**Multiplication properties:**

Identity property of multiplication:  1 x A = A

Commutative property of multiplication:  A x B = B x A

Associative property of multiplication:  (A x B) x C = A x (B x C)


**Distributive property of multiplication and division:**

example:  2 x (A + B)  =  (2 x A) + (2 x B)

example with numbers:  2 x 11 = 2 x (10 + 1) = (2 x 10) + (2 x 1) = 20 + 2 = 22


## Game Rules:

The Player has to catch the falling fruits in the order which would match the pattern of each math property.

The Player should avoid colliding with the fruits which do not match the pattern of each math property.


To advance to the next level, the Player has to get at least 85% of the questions correct.


**Novice level:**

The Player will catch the fruits in the correct order to place in the equations.  

The Player can choose which fruits to use.


**Apprentice level:**

After the Player has learned these math properties using fruit, the fruits will be replaced with numbers.


**Master level:**

The Player will apply the Distributive property to break down 2-digit multiplication questions.


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Arcade installed and running on your machine.

You can install Arcade by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```

After you’ve installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project’s root folder.

Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 math_properties.py
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

Start your IDE and open the project folder.

Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the “run” icon.


## Game Play:

Use these letter keys to move the catcher Player:

Left arrow == Left;

Right arrow == Right;

Q == Quit.

Player only moves horizontally.


## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:

```

root                    (project root folder)

+-- docs                (project documentation)

+-- math_properties     [src code files]

  +-- assets            (program asset files)

  +-- data              (program data files)

  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)

  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)

+-- LICENSE             (license file)

+-- README.md           (general info)

```
